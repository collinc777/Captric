
 OK, so now we at least have a redeployable database and web application.

 This means that we can production ready our application anywhere...AWS...engineyard, or just a home compurter

 This also means that a person can access our java application from the interenet.

 TODO:

Display an html file when hitting localhost:8080
    That's it!!! that's all we have to figure out
    Hints: look at how ROOT is usually deployed. Check stack overflow for deploying wars on tomcat

Once that is figured out, we want to create a TicketsController.java
    we can hit some route like /ticket/new and create a new ticket in the database
