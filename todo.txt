Todo:
 
 
 run db-deploy against the database
	-in the build.xml file we need to point to our database instance
	- run the db-deploy a few times to make sure migrations work multiple times
	
Java
	Create a DAO/DAOImpl
	DAO is a data accessor object
	These guys are the things that will tell our code how to save and retrieve object from the database
	We can also put small amounts of logic in here if we want
		-advise against it
	Basically with a DAO you will OPEN A SESSION to our database instance
		grab some stuf with a query
	CLOSE session
	
FOR NOW ONLY
	we can put our API slurper in the main body
